## 🚀 About Me

I am a B.TECH. C.S.E(UG) with a strong interest in **Data Analytics and Business Intelligence**.  
I focus on solving **real-world business problems using data**, not just building dashboards or writing queries.

My learning approach is simple:
> Understand the problem → analyze the data → communicate insights clearly → enable decisions

I am actively looking for opportunities where I can **contribute to real analytics work while continuously upskilling** in a data-driven environment.
